WORK YOUR ASS OFF
THERE IS NO MAGIC PILL
IT DRIVE ME CRAZY TO GO TO THE GYMv
IF YOU READ 1 HOUR DAY
I WENT AND WORKED OUT 5 HOURS A DAY
AND I WAS WORKING IN CONSTRUCTION
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS A DAY, ORGANISE YOUR DAY
WORK HARD

I'm here to talk about success
I went and worked out 5 hours a day
AND I WAS WORKING IN CONSTRUCTION
Because in those days in bodybuilding there was no money
I didn't have the money for food supplements or anything
So I had to go to work
So I worked in conctruction
I went to college and worked out in a gym
And at night from 8 o'clock at night to 12 midnight
I went to acting class 4 times a week 
I did all that
There was no one signal minute I wasted
This is why I'm standing here today
At the age of 20 I went to London
And I won the Mr.University contest as the youngest Mr.University ever
And it was because I had a goal
If you don't have a vision of where you're goging
If you don't have a goal where to go 
You drift around and never end up anywhere

74% of people hate their job in America
The majority of people don't like what they're doing
Because they are not doing it because they had a goal and followed the goal
They just aimlessly drift around and there is a job opening
So they get the job because they need to work
But then when you work it is a 
It's work
It's not fun
So only a quarter of people really enjoy what ther're doing in life
